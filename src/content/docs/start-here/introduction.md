Welcome to the documentation of the Scriptura API! This comprehensive API serves a wide range of **biblical resources**, allowing you to access and utilize various texts, translations, commentaries, and more. It provides detailed information about characters, places, and events in the Bible, and allows for connections between these resources to be explored.

The API supports both [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/), giving you the flexibility to choose the most suitable approach for your application.

Whether you're building a Bible study app, conducting research, or simply exploring the depths of biblical knowledge, the Scriptura API has you covered. We're excited to have you on board and look forward to seeing what you'll create with the Scriptura API. Happy coding!

### About us

The Scriptura project was created and maintained by [Lightstand](https://lightstand.io/), a non-profit organization of Christian developers dedicated to building software for the glory of God. We invite you to explore the link and consider joining us on this meaningful journey :)

Our mission is to develop a public API that not only provides Bible verses but also includes detailed information on the people, places, and events mentioned in those verses. This innovative tool aims to empower developers to create remarkable software that spreads the Word of God and serves as a testament to non-Christian developers.

Scriptura is more than just an API. We are also developing an intuitive and visual Bible study app, powered by our API, designed to enhance Bible study experiences.

Join us in our mission to glorify God through technology and inspire others by example.
